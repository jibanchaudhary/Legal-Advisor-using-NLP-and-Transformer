However, Nepal Police sources have denied any breach of their website, asserting that the data leak occurred from the cyber cafes' online forms, not from the police website itself. The attack is reportedly a retaliation for a previous cyber attack by a Nepali hacker group, 'Anonymous Nepal,' on Bangladeshi police websites.",
